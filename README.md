This repository showcases and compares different architectural patterns that can be used to build Android apps. The exact same sample app is built three times using the following approaches:
* __Standard Android__: traditional approach with layouts, Activities/Fragments and Model.
* __MVP__: Model View Presenter.
* __MVVM__: Model View ViewModel with data binding. 

## The App

The sample app displays a list of GitHub public repositories for a given username. Tapping on one of them will open a repository details screen, where more information about the repo can be found. This screen also shows information about the owner of the repository.
